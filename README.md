# xtr-talk

Talk like `xtr`. This program hasn't been tested with Windows or macOS, but im sure it will work there too.  
To get started, clone this repo, edit line 5 with your length, and run `make`.  
Next, run `./bin/xtr` and enjoy speaking like `xtr`.  
To add this as an alias, run `make link`. This will allow the compiled `xtr` binary to be aliased from `~/.xtr/bin`.
